                        "Biology has entered into an exciting new era in which phenomena that once seemed insoluble mysteries&mdash;such as embryonic development, the functions of the brain, and the dynamics of ecosystems&mdash;are now yielding their secrets as the technology to study them becomes more and more sophisticated. From molecular biology, with its potential to revolutionize medicine and agriculture, to ecology, with its lessons for the sustainable management of the environment, biologists are fully engaged in meeting the challenges of the future, helping to improve the quality of human life and to preserve habitats and biodiversity. Thus, it is no surprise that biology is at the heart of many of today&rsquo;s most pressing intellectual and social concerns. The Biology B.S. degree program gives students a rigorous education in modern biology, while allowing a student the opportunity to select from a wide array of upper-division elective courses offered by the departments of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. With proper advance planning, a student with virtually any degree can prepare a competitive application for medical school or health care professional school. &nbsp;Check the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mcd.ucsc.edu/academics/undergraduate/health-careers.html\" target=\"_blank\">Health Careers webpage</a> for more information on how you can academically prepare for a career in health care. &nbsp;Additional information is available at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.ucsc.edu/health/\" target=\"_blank\">UCSC Career Center</a>.",

It is an intensive program which includes all of the courses for the current film and digital media general major as well as all&nbsp;general education requirements and electives required for the university. Students may complete all courses required for the general major only. No concentration options are available for&nbsp;this pathway, though the general major does allow students to take up to two production courses.&nbsp;Students should begin this pathway in their frosh year to be able to complete the required courses in three years.

Such questions can be studied by looking at answers that contemporary philosophers propose, by investigating the principles that other disciplines use to legitimate claims, or by learning how, historically, philosophers approached these issues. In this respect, &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; names not only a historically defined subject matter, but also inquiry into any of the fundamental determinants of rational thought.

Both the National Marine Fisheries Service and the California Department of Fish and Game have laboratories located on the CSC, providing students with research and internship opportunities. Long Marine Laboratory on the CSC provides logistical support including diving and boating facilities, running seawater systems, and marine mammal facilities.

The major integrates education coursework and middle and high school classroom internships designed to develop skills and knowledge relevant to teaching K-12 students in the state of California. The major is mainly intended to prepare students for teacher certification programs and the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET), so that they can teach science in California high schools.&nbsp;",

Classes also develop skills in areas such as visual communication and team-oriented game production, while developing knowledge of topics such as game&nbsp;history, play experiences, game systems, and social and ethical issues. In their upper-division courses, students gain depth by taking electives in computational media and computer science and engineering, with options such as Game AI, Game Graphics and Real-Time Rendering, Mobile Applications, and Interactive Storytelling. A two-course interdisciplinary Game Development Experience&nbsp;and a yearlong interdisciplinary capstone Game Design Studio class allow students to develop substantial computer games and integrate materials from the rest of the program.",
